# Next-word-Predictor

Developed an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network to predict the next word in a sequence, leveraging text datasets for training and implementing sequence modeling and natural language processing(NLP) techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

use the dataset provided it may not get an excellent accuracy because of the size of data and the limitation the RNNs have can use transformers to get an very good accuracy
